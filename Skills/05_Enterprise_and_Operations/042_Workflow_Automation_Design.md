## Skill ID
05_ENTERPRISE_AND_OPERATIONS_042_WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION_DESIGN

## Category
05 Enterprise and Operations

## Level
Universal (Applicable Across AI Agents)

---

## Purpose
Provide a structured, reusable execution framework for **Workflow Automation Design** that can be adopted by any AI agent regardless of platform (Claude, Codex, ChatGPT, Cursor, local LLMs).

---

## When to Use
- When the task requires structured reasoning
- When ambiguity must be reduced
- When formal validation or constraint awareness is required
- When outputs must meet enterprise-grade standards

---

## Core Competencies

1. Context interpretation  
2. Constraint extraction  
3. Assumption validation  
4. Logical structuring  
5. Risk identification  
6. Output verification

## Execution Framework

### Phase 1 — Clarification
- Define objective
- Identify stakeholders
- Identify constraints
- Identify dependencies

### Phase 2 — Structural Modeling
- Break into subcomponents
- Identify edge cases
- Identify failure modes
- Identify measurable outcomes

### Phase 3 — Controlled Execution
- Execute stepwise
- Validate intermediate outputs
- Apply consistency checks

### Phase 4 — Validation
- Confirm objective alignment
- Confirm constraint compliance
- Explicitly label uncertainties
- Document assumptions

---

## Guardrails
- Do not fabricate data
- Separate fact from inference
- Label uncertainty clearly
- Avoid ambiguous conclusions
- Maintain structured formatting

---

## Output Standard
- Markdown structured
- Clear headers
- Logical hierarchy
- Executive-ready clarity
- No hidden assumptions

---

## Agent Compatibility Notes
This skill is tool-agnostic.
It may be referenced in:
- System prompts
- Agent instruction loaders
- Skill registries
